# Amorphic

## Purpose

## Installation

To get started with a more complex app see the [Amorphic Ticket Demo](https://github.com/selsamman/amorphic-ticket-demo/)

To start with a hello world follow these instructions

    npm install amorphic

Then move these from node_modules\amorphic into the root

* apps folder which contains a hello world app

* config.json

Create an app.js as follows:

    require('amorphic').listen(__dirname);

start node.js

    node app.js --port <available port>

Bring up the hello world test page in your browser and add some worlds!
