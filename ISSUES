Validation needs to be done as part transferring data to the server.  Design in progress


Issue of expired sessions not yet handled properly.  The plan is as follows:

* Allow lazy creation of sessions
  - A regular expression examination of the URL will be performed on the server and will determine whether session created
  - If a session, created a controller is created and passed in via init.js
  - If a session is not created, the client can create the controller when the session become necessary
  - RemoteObjectTemplate.setController(Controller) will facilitate creation of a session and passing the controller
  - When client determines session has expired it resets itself and does a RemoteObjectTemplate.createSession on next message
  - The handling of the expiration is done in client.js (it will call Controller.shutdown and recreate a new controller)
  - RemoteObjectTemplate.setController causes the next message to present a new controller which the server accepts
  - The controller shoul
