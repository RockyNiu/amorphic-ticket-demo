Amorphic is a framework for creating object-oriented web-based applications in nodeJS and mongoDB.

The key features include:

- A robust type system that supports object references and collections

- An object broker to keep object instances in sync between browser and server

- An ORM that persists the objects to MongoDB

- An application container for nodeJS to run the whole thing in

This project is alpha.  While it has been used to build a large and complex nodeJS application it has not undergone the rigor of being used on a breadth of projects and as such may not cater to all use cases.  It is also subject to change and currently does not have formal documentation.
